## Hi there!

This is Krist√≥f T√≥th from Hungary, located in the Netherlands pursuing my Master's program & Maastricht University.

I'm exploring the possibilities of text summarization with different transformer models, and researching if retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for context injection can cause any kind of performance improvement.

I was a software developer intern @ SAP Hungary, where I helped customers eliminate their issues with large-scale systems.

### Interests and knowledge

- Web development: Spring Boot, Angular, Next.js
- Data Science/Machine Learning: Pandas, PyTorch, Huggingface
