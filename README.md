## Hi there!

This is Krist√≥f T√≥th from Hungary, located in the Netherlands.

Currently pursuing my Master's degree @ UM.

I'm exploring the possibilities of text summarization with different transformer models, and if retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for context injection can cause any kind of performance improvement. 
This is my thesis topic.
